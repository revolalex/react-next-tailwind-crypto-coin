            <br />
            <p>I made this project because i wanted to learn next.js and pratice me react</p>
            <br />
            <p>Next.js is very cool! And quick to learn, it help making developpement much easier for example you don't need to manage the router and the server side rendering is just amazing!</p>
            <br/>
